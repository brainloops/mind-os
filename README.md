# Mind-OS 

What makes the idea of a generally intelligent AI so intoxicating is the notion that a human level intelligence could continually improve its own abilities through never ending, iterative changes. It could be tasked with one objective, and one objective only. To make itself smarter. The software could make the software better and better with each new version, and replace itself at each level. This would snowball into a super AI that gets better so quickly it would reach escape velocity and eclipse its humble beginnings by an unfathomable degree. And never stop.

Why wait for an AI capable of evolving its own software to exist when we already have a general intelligence, our own brain.

But how do you make software that could run on our own brains?

Our brains have many of the foundational capabilities readily available.
- Short term memory for holding instructions to be executed
- Long term memory for storing representations we have learned
- Attentional control necessary for procedural execution of sequential instructions
- Input / Output actuators for communicating with other minds
- Subsystems for handling specialized tasks
- Reward / inhibitions mechanisms for making adjustments based on new information

Challenges
How do you load the software into your brain and push updates?

How do you keep the software running throughout the day when you have some many demands on your attention?

How would you stay motivated to continuously improve your minds software?
