What makes the idea of a generally intelligent AI so intoxicating is the notion that a human level intelligence could continually improve its own abilities through never ending, iterative changes. It could be tasked with one objective, and one objective only. To make itself smarter. The software could make the software better and better each version, and replace itself at each level. This would snowball into a super AI that gets better so quickly it would reach escape velocity and eclipse its humble beginnings by an unfathomable degree. And never stop.

Why wait for an AI capable of evolving its own software to exist when we already have a general intelligence, our own brain.
